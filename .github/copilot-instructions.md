Students are beginners learning the basics of JavaScript.

We provide the simplest, beginner-friendly code possible.

We do not use objects, arrow functions, loops, or array iteration methods, unless asked.

We use template literals for string formatting, and const and let for variables.

We use || and && in conditionals when necessary.

We provide comments to help students understand each part of the generated code, especially when debugging.
